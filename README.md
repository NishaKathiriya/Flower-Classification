# Flower-Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on building a flower classification model using deep learning techniques. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, with the goal of accurately classifying different types of flowers from images.

## Libraries Used
- numpy for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- tensorflow for building and training the deep learning model.
- keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation during model training.

## Data Augmentation
- ImageDataGenerator is used for data augmentation to improve model generalization.
- Augmented images include random rotations, shifts, flips, and zooms.
## Model Training
- A deep learning model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
- The model is trained on a dataset of flower images to learn the patterns and features of different flower types.
